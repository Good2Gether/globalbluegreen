      <h3> What is the purpose of this research?</h3>
      <p>
        This research study is being conducted by â€¦ . 
        This study will help us better understand human decision-making.
      </p>
      <h3> What can I expect if I take part in this research?</h3>
      <p>
        The survey will take approximately  XX minutes to complete,
        and you will be paid XX for your time. <br>
        Should you choose to participate in this research study,
        you will answer some questions about yourself. This study requires webcam access.
        At some point during the study, we will ask for permission to turn on your webcam.
        The data that we will be recording is where you appear to be looking on your computer
        screen, but not the webcam recording itself. This data consists of only two numbers and we
        do not access either your screen or your video. There will be x calibration procedures during
        the study to correctly measure your gaze location. 
      </p>
      <p>
        During the study, you may be asked personal or sensitive information that is
        important for the results of the study. To our knowledge, there are no risks
        associated with this research study. The records of your responses will be coded
        in a completely anonymous way. No names or sensitive biographic information will be
        asked of you. Your records will be arbitrarily assigned a subject code number by the system.
        To secure the transparency of scientific findings, the completely anonymized data set will be
        published and made available to other researchers.
        Potential purposes of future analyses of the data cannot be determined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though it would greatly help us to be able to measure your answers, please feel
        free to skip questions that you do not
        want to answer and remember that all information that you provide is completely confidential in nature.
      </p>
